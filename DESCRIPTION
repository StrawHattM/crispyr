Description: crispyr processes multiplexed FASTQ files from pooled CRISPR screens into 
    construct and gene-level count matrices. It implements barcode extraction, library 
    matching, sample demultiplexing, and quality control similar to the Broad Institute's 
    PoolQ tool. The package outputs raw counts and log-normalized matrices suitable for 
    downstream statistical analysis of screening hits.
