\title{Locate genes in grouped data}
\usage{
where_is(genes, data, return_full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{Character vector of gene identifiers to search for.}

\item{data}{One of the following:
\itemize{
\item A named list of character vectors (each containing gene IDs)
\item A dataframe with columns \code{id} and \code{square} (NineSquares format)
\item A ggplot object (data will be extracted from the \code{data} slot)
\item A named list of ggplot objects (returns a named list of results)
\item A named list of dataframes with \code{id} and \code{square} columns (returns a named list of results)
}}

\item{return_full}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{data} is a list, returns the full
vectors containing each gene rather than just the vector names. Ignored for
NineSquares data. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
For single gene input: a character vector of group/square names where
the gene was found, or \code{character(0)} if not found. For multiple genes: a
named list where each element contains the character vector of groups/squares
for that gene. When \code{data} is a named list of graphs or dataframes, returns
a named list where names correspond to the input list names and values are
the square locations.
}
\description{
Find which groups or squares contain specified genes. Accepts either a list
of named character vectors (e.g., from NSextractdata results) or NineSquares
dataframe output, or a named list of graphs or graph data.
