\title{Locate genes in grouped data}
\usage{
where_is(genes, data, return_full = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{Character vector of gene identifiers to search for.}

\item{data}{Either a named list of character vectors (each containing gene
IDs) or a dataframe with columns \code{id} and \code{square} (NineSquares format).}

\item{return_full}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{data} is a list, returns the full
vectors containing each gene rather than just the vector names. Ignored for
NineSquares data. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
For single gene input: a character vector of group/square names where
the gene was found, or \code{character(0)} if not found. For multiple genes: a
named list where each element contains the character vector of groups/squares
for that gene.
}
\description{
Find which groups or squares contain specified genes. Accepts either a list
of named character vectors (e.g., from NSextractdata results) or NineSquares
dataframe output.
}
