\title{Aggregate Reads by Sample Barcode}
\usage{
aggregate_by_sample_barcode(
  mapped_reads,
  sample_manifest,
  keep_unmatched_samples = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapped_reads}{A data.table from \code{\link[=map_constructs_to_genes]{map_constructs_to_genes()}} containing
barcode mapping results with a \code{sample_barcode} column.}

\item{sample_manifest}{A tibble/data.frame from \code{\link[=load_sample_manifest]{load_sample_manifest()}} mapping
8bp sample barcodes to condition names.}

\item{keep_unmatched_samples}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, keep reads with sample barcodes
not in the manifest. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, suppress progress messages. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \link[data.table:data.table]{data.table::data.table} with input columns plus:
\itemize{
\item \code{condition}: Sample condition/name from the manifest
\item \code{sample_barcode_matched}: Logical indicating if sample barcode was found in manifest
}
}
\description{
Groups extracted barcodes by their 8bp sample barcode and maps them to
experimental conditions/samples using the sample manifest.
