# crispyr

crispyr is intended as a collection of wrappers for CRISPR-Cas9 analysis. 

Right now it is very much in early development and I'm using it primarily for internal 
use and to get familiar with package building.

## Installation

You couldn install the development version of crispyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("StrawHattM/crispyr")
```

or 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StrawHattM/crispyr")
```

but it's probably not going to do much for you 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(crispyr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
